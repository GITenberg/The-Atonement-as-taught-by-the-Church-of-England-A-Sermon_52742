Institute</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That the objects of the Society be to awaken the
attention of Protestant Christians to the progress of Popery; to
call forth and unite their energies in opposing it; and to form a
rallying-point, as well for the defence and promotion of
Protestant truth, as for the maintenance of the Protestant
principles of the Constitution.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That the principal means for the attainment of this
object be: the issue of suitable publications; the enrolment of
the names of members; public meetings, lectures, and sermons;
addresses and deputations to Parliamentary representatives;
petitions to the Legislature, or the Sovereign; and
correspondence with kindred Societies, with a view to obtain and
communicate information.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; That the Society be conducted by a President,
Treasurer, Committee, and two Clerical and two Lay
Secretaries.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; That Members be of two classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That every person contributing a Donation of Five
Guineas or upwards, at one time, or an Annual Subscription of
Five Shillings or upwards, be a Subscribing Member.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That every person from among the operative classes,
who shall be recommended by two Subscribing Members, be
admissible as a Free Member, subject to annual re-election.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&mdash;And that all Members be entitled to attend the
General Meetings of the Society, and to receive the Annual
Reports, and other publications, as far as the funds will admit,
preference being given to the Subscribing Members, to whom also
the privilege of voting will be confined.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; That a Committee be annually elected, consisting of
thirty Lay Subscribing Members, together with all Clergy resident
in the parish who are likewise Subscribing Members of the
Society, with power to fill up vacancies.&nbsp; That this
Committee elect, either from among themselves or from other
Subscribing Members, District Sub-committees, with a view to
carrying out the objects of the Society generally in the
parish.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; That the General Committee receive the Reports of
the District Sub-committees; determine on the admission and
annual re-election of Free Members, in pursuance of Rule V.;
regulate all matters of expenditure; suggest plans for general
adoption; and supply such publications as may be required for
distribution.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; That all publications circulated by the Society be
first approved by the General Committee, and bear the stamp of
the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Islington Protestant
Institute</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; That the General Committee meet on the third Monday
in every month, and oftener, if needful.&nbsp; Five members to
constitute a quorum.</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; That an Annual Meeting of the Members of the Society
be held in the month of November, on such day as may be fixed by
the General Committee; when the proceedings of the foregoing year

<p>XI.&nbsp; That the Secretaries shall call a Special General
Meeting on the requisition of not less than twenty Subscribing
Members; that such requisition be in writing, and specify the
object for which the meeting is to be summoned; and that not less
than seven days&rsquo; notice be given, by circular, to the
Subscribing Members of the Society.</p>
<p>XII.&nbsp; That none of the Rules of the Society be repealed

or at a Special General Meeting called for that purpose.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; That all Meetings of the Society be opened with
prayer, and closed with benediction.</p>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; That it be earnestly recommended to all the members

family.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>N.B.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Contributions in aid of the Institute will
be thankfully received by any of the officers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As the pecuniary qualification for Membership has
been fixed at the low rate of 5s., and as every Subscribing
Member receives, in the form of publications, considerably more
than an equivalent for that sum, it is obvious that the Society
can only be maintained by the liberality of such as can afford to
contribute more largely to its Funds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; All the publications of the Institute may be
purchased at Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s, Bookseller and Publisher,
Islington Green.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Parties contemplating the formation of similar
Societies in any part of the country, are cordially invited to
correspond with the officers of the Institute, who will also be
thankful for any authentic information and friendly communication
from Societies already in existence.</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 JOHN II. 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;AND
HE IS THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible to overrate the
deep importance of the holy subject presented to us by these
blessed words.&nbsp; They lead us to the foundation of the
believer&rsquo;s faith; and announce the great fact upon which
our life depends.&nbsp; They bear with them all the deep
interests of eternity, for without the atonement we are
unquestionably lost, while receiving the atonement we are no less
unquestionably safe.&nbsp; Measure therefore, if you can, the
difference between the poor unhappy soul spending eternity in the
agonies of the damned, and a blessed spirit rejoicing before the
throne of God, and filled with delight in the unfettered exercise
of holy love, and you may thence gain a scale or standard whereby
to estimate the work of Jesus, when he gave himself as the
propitiation for our sin.</p>
<p>May the Holy Spirit be with us and direct our
investigation!&nbsp; May He take of the things of Christ, and
show them unto us!&nbsp; May He so solemnize our hearts by his
grace, that, in the spirit of little children, we may search his
word with meekness!&nbsp; And may He so enlighten our
understanding, that we may be guided by that word into the
peaceful enjoyment of his saving truth!</p>
<p>We are to examine, then, the doctrine of atonement, as taught
by the Church of England; and in doing so we will endeavour to
investigate the end, the plan, and some of the leading
characteristics of the work.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The <i>end</i>, or <i>purpose</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, the
object to attain which our Lord was made a propitiation.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>This
object is stated in our Second Article to be, &ldquo;to reconcile
his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original,
but also for actual sins of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is in every natural heart a deep sense of alienation
from God an irresistible conviction that the soul is not safe
with him.&nbsp; It pervades all classes and all characters.&nbsp;
It is felt by the profligate, for however earnestly he may strive
to stifle conscience, he cannot altogether still the conviction
that the path he is treading is the way to hell.&nbsp; The
moralist feels it, for with all his propriety of outward conduct,
and with all the delusive self-satisfaction which he grains from
comparing his character with that of others, there remains a
still small voice, which assures him, in language not to be
mistaken, that in God&rsquo;s sight he is defective, that
God&rsquo;s will has not been obeyed, and that his law has been
most sadly broken.&nbsp; The formalist feels it, for, while, in
the earnestness of his religion, he pursues with unremitting zeal
his appointed course of rites and services, there is still a want
of peace in the inmost recesses of his soul; there is earnestness
without love, zeal without joy, religion without peace, and
active devotion without any rest in communion with God.</p>
<p>Now this sense of alienation in the heart is nothing more than
the echo, or reflection, of God&rsquo;s testimony in the
Scripture.&nbsp; There is a perfect harmony between conscience
and the Bible.&nbsp; They both convey God&rsquo;s testimony,
written in the one case on the secrets of the heart, and in the
other on the pages of the inspired word.&nbsp; Both acknowledge
the sense of alienation.&nbsp; But the Bible goes the farthest,
and while the heart can only deplore the fact, the Scriptures
explain both its causes and its remedy.&nbsp; Turning, then, to
the word of God, we discover that there are two causes for this
uneasiness of spirit,&mdash;our own sin, and God&rsquo;s
judgment.&nbsp; We are all by nature, according to our Article,
&ldquo;very far gone from original righteousness;&rdquo; and,
according to the language of the Scriptures, &ldquo;the carnal
mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of
God, neither indeed can be; so then they that are in the flesh
cannot please God:&rdquo; words clearly descriptive of an enmity
on our part towards him.&nbsp; Then, again, that same Article
teaches us that &ldquo;in every person born into the world this
inbred sin deserveth God&rsquo;s wrath and damnation,&rdquo; in
exact accordance with the same Scripture, which declares, that
&ldquo;the wrath of God is <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>revealed against all unrighteousness
and disobedience of men;&rdquo; showing that on God&rsquo;s part
there is a judicial wrath, and that, as a holy lawgiver, he
cannot love the guilty.&nbsp; If any, therefore, inquire the
reason of this secret uneasiness in his soul, we reply, that the
cause is twofold; it is partly because his own heart is at enmity
with God, and partly because God&rsquo;s holiness is at enmity
with him.&nbsp; There is the corruption of his own nature which
makes him at variance with God&rsquo;s will, and there is the
curse of unforgiven sin, which shuts him out from all enjoyment
of God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Now the end or object of the atonement is to remove that curse
entirely and at once, so that, God being reconciled to the
sinner, the sinner may be reconciled to God, and the anxious soul
restored to peace.&nbsp; A regret has been expressed that our
Second Article was not worded differently, and that it was not
written, &ldquo;to reconcile us to the Father,&rdquo; instead of,
&ldquo;to reconcile the Father to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the wish
of such objectors to convey the idea that the object of the
crucifixion was to remove one only of the causes of separation,
and to produce such a moral impression on the mind of the
spectator as should soften his heart, and do away with his enmity
towards God; they would exclude the thought of God being
reconciled to us by the satisfaction of his righteous law.&nbsp;
But this is the great and primary effect of atonement, as taught
in sacred Scripture.&nbsp; The change in man&rsquo;s heart is a
consequence which follows from it, but the change in God&rsquo;s
regard to the sinner is the one effect immediately produced by
it.&nbsp; Its one object was to enable him to spare the sinner
without departing from his law, to give full vent to his love
without detracting from his holiness, to take the curse away that
the sinner, who deserved it, might be loved as an adopted
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness, that he might
be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in
Jesus.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>Imagine yourself, then, freely forgiven, with the whole curse
gone; loved as if you had never known the smallest taint of sin,
beloved by God himself as if you had been holy even as the Son of
man, enjoying access to the throne without a fear, and welcomed
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>by Him
without a hinderance.&nbsp; Imagine yourself, though lost,
fallen, and guilty, thus pardoned, thus beloved, while the
holiness of God&rsquo;s law remains untouched and undiminished,
and you see the end or purpose of the atonement on the cross.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; What, then, was the <i>plan</i> by which this mighty
change was effected,&mdash;by which God was thus reconciled to
man?</p>
<p>It could not be done by the mere remission of sin, for then
the law of God would have been dishonoured, the sentence passed
would not have been executed, and the pardon of the sinner would
have been a departure from the truth of God.</p>
<p>The plan, therefore, which he purposed was in the person of
the eternal Son to bear the curse himself, and to make
satisfaction for the broken law.&nbsp; In his holiness he could
not remit it, so in unutterable love he bore it.&nbsp; What could
not be done through bare remission could be done through
substitution; and the Son himself was prepared and offered as a
substitute.&nbsp; There was never such a person, nor such a
scheme.&nbsp; In order to represent man, he became himself
perfect man.&nbsp; In order to satisfy the law, he first in his
life fulfilled its holiness, and then in his death bore its
sentence.&nbsp; Thus the satisfaction for sin was perfect.&nbsp;
The law passed sentence on man, and man endured it.&nbsp; The law
claimed fulfilment, and man fulfilled it.&nbsp; The law required
a worthy substitute for the whole race, and He, with all the
attributes of the Godhead, was amply sufficient as a ransom for
the world.</p>
<p>Thus his work is sometimes called atonement, because, by his
own death, he atoned for sin, or presented an equivalent for the
sinner&rsquo;s guilt; sometimes expiation, because it expiated or
took away the wrath due to sin; sometimes it is called
satisfaction, because, in his death, he satisfied the law;
sometimes oblation, because he was offered on the cross, as the
lamb was offered on the altar; and sometimes propitiation,
because the wrath of God was propitiated, so that he loves those
whom before he regarded with righteous displeasure; but in all
cases the leading idea is the same, viz., that punishment was
required by God&rsquo;s righteousness, and that he endured it as
the representative or substitute of the sinner.&nbsp; The
satisfaction of an unchangeable sentence was its one great
object.&nbsp; It was God&rsquo;s act of homage to the unbending
holiness of his law.&nbsp; There was in it the perfect display of
two attributes, love and justice; love which prompted him to save
the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>ruined,
and justice which required the sacrifice, in order that the
purpose of love might be fulfilled.&nbsp; Thus the atonement is
the one central point in which &ldquo;mercy and truth are met
together, and righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; From this brief and general view of the doctrine of
atonement, we may proceed at once to some of the <i>leading
truths respecting it</i>, more especially dwelling upon those
which form the distinctive teaching of the Church of England, as
contrasted with that of Rome.&nbsp; These may be summed up under
three heads:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; That there can be no other satisfaction for
sin.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; That the satisfaction made by our Lord was
complete.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; That it was final.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; And, in the first place, it must be obvious that
<i>nothing else can make a satisfaction for sin</i>.&nbsp; There
is in the human heart a constant tendency to strive after some
expiation, a tendency which is seen in Heathen as well as
Christian lands, and which is nothing more than the natural
effort of the unenlightened heart to shake off the burden of its
guilt.&nbsp; But, before the cross of Christ, all such tendencies
should at once disappear, and the immeasurable costliness of the
Divine remedy should stamp all human schemes with
nothingness.&nbsp; If man could do anything to make expiation for
his sin, then why did the Son of God suffer? why the great
mystery of the incarnation? why the agony in the garden? why the
hiding of God&rsquo;s countenance? and why the assurance that sin
is blotted out through the Saviour&rsquo;s most precious
blood?&nbsp; We need only look for a moment to the eternal
divinity of the whole plan, to the deep mystery of the
incarnation, and to that marvellous fact, that in the hour of his
deepest need the Son was forsaken of the Father, to be well
assured of the most certain truth, that nothing that man could do
could, in any form or any circumstances, avail to make
satisfaction for his sin.</p>
<p>The Church of England, therefore, has decided in the
Thirty-first Article, after describing the perfection of the work
of our Lord,&mdash;&ldquo;And there is none other satisfaction
for sin but that alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in this respect we are
in direct opposition to the Church of Rome, for, although its
advocates admit in words the completeness of the atonement, and
in theological discussion would trace all merit to it as the
fountain-head, yet there are numberless decrees and practices
which show too plainly that <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>many other satisfactions have been
practically admitted into their system.&nbsp; For example, the
Council of Trent decreed, &ldquo;That such is the abundance of
the Divine bounty, that we are able to make satisfaction to God
the Father, through Christ Jesus, not only by punishments
voluntarily endured by us as chastisements for sin, or imposed at
the pleasure of the priests, according to the degree of the
offence, and also (and this is an amazing proof of love) by
temporal pains inflicted by God himself, and by us patiently
borne.&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; Now, although in this very decree
all is said to be through Christ, it must be plain to the
practical and simple mind, that there are two new sources of
satisfaction opened to the sinner,&mdash;the voluntary infliction
of penance, and the patient endurance of involuntary pain.</p>
<p>With reference to the latter, it is indeed a beautiful thing
to see this fruit of the Spirit abounding in the chastened child
of God; the Lord&rsquo;s love is thereby glorified, and the
comforts of the Holy Ghost are brought experimentally to the
view.&nbsp; But where do we read that such affliction, or such
patience, is to be regarded as expiation?&nbsp; It may be like
the refiner&rsquo;s fire, by means of which the Lord draws out
the pure gold for his diadem, for he says himself, &ldquo;I have
chosen thee in the furnace of affliction,&rdquo; but it has no
connexion with expiation.&nbsp; The source of expiation is Divine
justice, the means of it is punishment, and the end is the
satisfaction of the law; the source of chastisement, on the other
hand, is love, for &ldquo;whom the Lord loveth, he
chasteneth;&rdquo; the means of it may be sorrow, as the widow
wept that she might rejoice over her risen son; but the end is
that we are made more like to Christ, for &ldquo;he does it for
our profit, that we might be partakers of his
holiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let no afflicted believer, then, suppose
that God is angry with him in his trouble, or that by his patient
endurance he can make satisfaction for his sin.&nbsp; Rather let
him take his sorrow as a pledge of love, as a sweet token that
the Lord <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>has not left him to the wanderings of his sinful heart,
but is drawing him nearer to himself, and preparing him for a
bright place in the coming kingdom of his Lord.</p>
<p>And as for the other idea, that our own self-inflicted pains
can make satisfaction for our sins, we need scarcely look even to
the scriptural testimony for its overthrow.&nbsp; If a man were
left for execution by an earthly judge, would his sentence be
remitted if it were proved that, during his imprisonment, he had
thought it right to abstain from meat?&nbsp; And if God&rsquo;s
heavy wrath frowns on a soul, and his justice demands the
execution of his law, is it likely, I ask, that the sentence
should be remitted because the sinner has thought it right to do
penance for a week?&nbsp; The Catechism of Trent even presumes to
say that penance is &ldquo;as it were, a compensation for
sin.&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; Now, what penance can make a
compensation to God? what acts of repentance are there so perfect
that they do not themselves require to be repented of? and, if
any such could be found, how could they make satisfaction for
sin? how could the right of to-day be a compensation for the
wrong of yesterday?&nbsp; No; if that were our hope, we might
weep till the ocean overflowed with the deep tide of our
penitential tears; we might lacerate and emaciate the poor human
frame till it could no longer contain the worn and peaceless
spirit; but, after all, there could be no peace, no satisfaction,
no propitiation of God&rsquo;s justice, and therefore no relief
from the weight and burden of our sin.&nbsp; No; we must abandon
all thoughts of satisfaction, and throw ourselves as we are
before the cross of Christ, in a simple reliance on the one great
fact, that he, as our perfect substitute, has blotted out the
whole by his own most precious blood.&nbsp; Our satisfaction is
that Christ has died, and that alone is sure to be sufficient,
for it was purposed by the Father in his own eternal counsels;
our atonement has been made by the spotless Redeemer, the eternal
Son, and while we adore its full perfection, we give up all
thoughts of mixing with it, or adding to it, the poor, defective,
imperfect, sin-stricken efforts, which frail, feeble man may
strive to make in order to effect a yet further compensation for
his sin.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; It is <i>complete</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, according to
the language of our Articles, it is a &ldquo;perfect redemption,
propitiation, and satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is amply
sufficient for the completion of the purposed <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>work, the
removal of God&rsquo;s curse, and his full reconciliation to the
lost and guilty sinner.</p>
<p>Now, in order to this completeness there are two things
plainly necessary; viz., that it should be free in its
application, and perfect in its effect; or, in other words, that
the pardon procured by it should be both <i>free</i> and
<i>full</i>; free, for it must reach to the lowest depths of the
sinner&rsquo;s fall, or it can never open the door of life to
those who are lost in sin; and full, for when it blots out sin,
it must blot it out completely, or it can never admit the
pardoned believer to the peaceful enjoyment of the love of
God.</p>
<p>When, therefore, we speak of a full satisfaction, we include
both these truths, and in both these respects we are at direct
variance with Rome.</p>
<p>As to the first, it is the doctrine of the Church of England
that the work wrought out by Him was so complete, that there was
nothing left for the sinner to do, in order to qualify himself
for pardon, but that salvation is offered us on the simple terms,
&ldquo;Believe, and live.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are accounted
righteous before God <i>only</i> for the merit of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to give any short and clear
definition of the doctrine of the Church of Rome upon the
subject, for it is a complicated maze, through which her
followers are obliged to tread.&nbsp; But the idea throughout is
that there must be something in us, as it were, to meet the work
of atonement, some satisfaction on the part of the sinner, to
qualify him for the reception of the satisfaction of the
Lord.&nbsp; In words they would state that the atonement was
complete, but in its application of it to ruined souls they
neutralize the statement, by demanding something on our part as a
condition of our being pardoned through it.&nbsp; It is as though
the veil of the temple had been rent from the top almost to the
bottom, but still a small fragment left which the sinner must
divide, before he can go in before the mercy-seat.&nbsp; It is as
though there were a debt of 100<i>l.</i>, or any other sum, and
the creditor said to the debtor, Your friend has paid the whole,
and you shall be free, provided that you now pay down
1<i>l.</i>&nbsp; It matters not what is the character, or what
the amount of the remaining sum, which the debtor is <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>required to
pay in order to procure the gift of proffered freedom; the simple
fact of any such demand destroys the perfection of the ransom of
the substitute.&nbsp; As Hooker said of this same system,
&ldquo;I cannot stand now to unrip this building, and sift it
piece by piece,&rdquo; and I believe there is no occasion to do
so, as none who are acquainted with Romish teaching can deny that
there is some such demand made on every adult before the
Lord&rsquo;s atonement can be made efficacious for his
pardon.&nbsp; In some cases the thing demanded is personal
sanctification, according to which a person must be holy before
he can be justified in his Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man shall
say that men are justified either by the sole imputation of the
righteousness of Christ, or the sole remission of our sins, and
not by grace and charity, which is diffused in their hearts by
the Holy Spirit, and is inherent in them, let him be
anathema.&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; Sometimes it is good works, as
in the Catechism of the Council of Trent, which declares that
through the atonement we obtain by good works two great benefits,
&ldquo;one that we deserve the rewards of immortal
glory&mdash;the other that we make satisfaction for our
sins.&rdquo; <a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; The whole, it says,
&ldquo;depends on the merit of our Lord&rsquo;s passion;&rdquo;
but the good works are represented as acts on our part, through
which that atonement is made effectual to our case.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is penance, through which mortal sin after baptism
is said to be remitted, and of which the Council of Trent
decrees, &ldquo;Whoever shall affirm that the satisfactions by
which penitents redeem themselves from sin through Christ Jesus,
are no part of the service of God, but on the contrary, human
traditions which obscure the doctrine of grace, and the true
worship of God, and the benefits of the death of Christ, let him
be anathema.&rdquo; <a name="citation13c"></a><a
href="#footnote13c" class="citation">[13c]</a></p>
<p>Now believers in the Bible are not afraid boldly to say,
&ldquo;Let that anathema rest on us,&rdquo; for we do believe
from the bottom of our heart that the doctrine of grace is
obscured and neutralized by such a system of human
satisfaction.&nbsp; We believe it to be utterly impossible for
penitents to redeem themselves from sin by any satisfaction
whatsoever.&nbsp; &ldquo;It cost more to redeem their souls, so
that they must let that alone for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; We believe
at the same time that there is no such satisfaction needed, but
that the whole judgment has been so completely <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>borne, as to
lay open the treasury of life to the sinner, even in the lowest
depths of his ruin; so that when he has nothing to bring, and can
have nothing, and has no prospect of ever having anything at any
future time, we can proclaim to him in the words of the Holy
Ghost, &ldquo;Ho! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea,
come, buy wine and milk without money and without
price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before we quit the subject of the completeness of the
atonement we must remember its fulness or perfection towards the
pardoned believer.&nbsp; We have found that the completeness of
the atonement is practically neutralized by the demand of some
human satisfaction, in order that the Lord&rsquo;s propitiation
may be made applicable to the sinner; but now another question
arises, of the deepest possible importance,&mdash;Is the sinner,
when forgiven, forgiven completely?&nbsp; Is his sin fully or
only partially blotted out?&nbsp; Hitherto we have spoken merely
of the man seeking forgiveness, and found how he is required by
the Church of Rome to do something before he can reach up to the
atonement; now let us proceed a step further, and examine the
case of one who has obtained it, <i>i.e.</i>, of the pardoned
believer,&mdash;of the accepted child of God.&nbsp; How does he
stand with reference to those sins which have been pardoned
through the blood of propitiation?&nbsp; Does any portion of the
guilt or charge of them lie against him after his forgiveness? or
is the whole removed and blotted out for ever?</p>
<p>It may appear strange to some that I have even raised the
question, for the language of sacred scripture is so plain and so
often repeated, that those who are familiar with its pages will
at once call to mind a host of passages, which place the matter
beyond the range of controversy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though your sins be
as scarlet they shall be as white as snow; and though they be red
like crimson they shall be as wool.&rdquo;&nbsp; If they are as
white as snow, there is surely no stain left.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is therefore no trace or recollection of
its blot.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation for
them that are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; There cannot
therefore be a guilt or a condemnation left.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath
made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him;&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, that the
righteousness of God might be imputed to us, just as our guilt
was laid <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>upon him; and if that is the case, can there be any
vestige left, any remnant of the stain or curse?&nbsp; Surely
guilt must be gone if we stand before the throne in the
righteousness of Jesus.&nbsp; There is no stain on his garment,
no defect in his love.&nbsp; It is perfect, spotless, and
untainted for eternity; and the believer, who is clad in it, may
cast to the winds all thought of punishment for bygone sin, and
let his soul repose in the peaceful enjoyment of unimpeded
love.</p>
<p>But now contrast with this the teaching of the Church of
Rome.&nbsp; The Council of Trent decreed, &ldquo;If any man shall
say that after the gift of justification has been received, sin
is so remitted to any repentant sinner, and the debt of eternal
punishment so blotted out, that there remains no debt of
temporary punishment to be endured either in this world, or in
the world to come, in purgatory, before a way can be opened into
the kingdom of heaven, let him be anathema.&rdquo; <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a>&nbsp; You observe, that the persons
alluded to in the decree are justified believers, by whom the
gift of justification has been already received, and whose sin is
remitted; you observe also that the state of mind in which they
are described is that of true repentance, for they are said to be
&ldquo;repentant sinners;&rdquo; and yet the decree distinctly
declares that there still hangs over them the remaining
punishment of unforgiven sin.&nbsp; It is true that the
punishment is described as temporary, but the fact that there is
any punishment at all is a virtual denial of the completeness of
the atonement, for there can be no punishment if there is no
remaining charge of sin; and there can be no remaining charge, if
all has been satisfied by the blood-shedding of the Lord.</p>
<p>But let us refer to one other extract.&nbsp; In the Catechism
of Trent an explanation is given of the doctrines defined in the
decrees, and there we find the same distinction between eternal
and temporal punishments; we find also a distinction between
God&rsquo;s mercy and his justice, and it says of God, that
&ldquo;through his mercy he forgives sins, and the eternal
punishments due to them; through his justice he punishes the man
with punishments of limited duration.&rdquo; <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; The justice, therefore, of God
is described as still in exercise against the believer.&nbsp; The
Scriptures teach us that, being satisfied, it is enlisted on our
behalf, for &ldquo;if we confess our sins,&rdquo; he is not
merely merciful, but &ldquo;is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; How, I would ask, can it be just to
forgive, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>because of the merit of a finished expiation, and at the
same time just to demand a fresh expiation from this forgiven
sinner for his forgiven sin? and what has become of the
completeness of that satisfaction which the Lord wrought out for
us as our substitute, if the justice, after all, be not fully
satisfied, but the wrath of God still hangs over the accepted
soul?</p>
<p>These extracts, however, merely explain the general theory,
and we shall probably be able to understand it better if we
examine an instance of its practical application.</p>
<p>We shall find just such an instance in the case of
purgatory.&nbsp; The Catechism of Trent declares of it,
&ldquo;Besides (hell) there is a fire of purgatory, in which the
souls of the pious, being tormented for a define time, expiate
their sin, that so an entrance may be opened to them into the
eternal country, into which nothing defiled can
enter.&rdquo;&nbsp; You observe that according to these words,
the persons in purgatory are pious believers, heirs of the
kingdom, blessed spirits, who are about to reign with
Christ.&nbsp; You observe, in the next place, that they are in
the torture of fire, not gently and sweetly spiritualised, but
burnt up and tortured; and you observe, in the third place, that
the purpose of it is to make expiation for their sin.&nbsp; It is
not to purify or refine, to chasten, that so they may be
partakers of God&rsquo;s holiness; but it is to expiate, to make
atonement, to satisfy that unsatisfied justice, of which we read
in the preceding extract.&nbsp; They are said to make an
expiation by torture, in addition to that which the Saviour has
already made for them by his blood.&nbsp; His expiation is
represented as not enough to introduce them to the kingdom, but
is said to leave them with so much of sin&rsquo;s defilement,
that their own burning is required to complete the work.</p>
<p>Now we would earnestly put it to every conscientious Roman
Catholic, Can such a system be reconciled with the teaching of
the Scripture respecting the Lord&rsquo;s atonement?&nbsp; Did
the Son of God really offer himself as our ransom, and was that
ransom so insufficient that our own expiation is required
still?&nbsp; Did God legally declare that there is no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, and yet does he
condemn those very persons to expiating torments in purgatorial
flame?&nbsp; Are we made through his atonement the righteousness
of God in him, and yet are we held so accountable for sin as to
lie for centuries under his heavy wrath?&nbsp; Has he really
promised, &ldquo;Their sins and their iniquities <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>will I
remember no more,&rdquo; and yet does he remember those very sins
for centuries, while, in the exercise of unrelenting justice, he
demands expiation from a suffering soul?&nbsp; Oh! no, brethren,
&ldquo;By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified:&rdquo; he hath blotted out the curse, and blotted it
out completely; he hath rent the veil from the top to the bottom,
and removed all barriers between the sinner and the throne.&nbsp;
We need no expiation, or satisfaction, to qualify us for the
reception of the atonement, for it reaches down to the lowest
point of our ruin, and proclaims to the most guilty, &ldquo;Thy
curse is borne, believe and live.&rdquo;&nbsp; It needs no second
expiation to fill it up and perfect it, for there is not a spot
left in the garment which he cleanses, not a sin imputed to the
blessed saint whom he justifies.&nbsp; Only let each of us be
found amongst the number, pardoned through the atonement and
accepted, through the righteousness of Christ.&nbsp; Then we may
go without fear to the throne of grace, and boldly cry, Abba
Father; then we may feel the deepest conviction for indwelling
sin, but may rest in the fact that there is no condemnation, and
may feast the soul in the full enjoyment of everlasting love;
then we may adopt with heartfelt gratitude the ever-memorable
words of Hooker,&mdash;&ldquo;I must take heed what I say; but
the Apostle saith, &lsquo;God made him to be sin for us, who knew
no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such are we in the sight of God the Father, as
is the Son of God himself.&nbsp; Let it be counted folly, or
frenzy, or fury, whatsoever, it is our comfort and our wisdom; we
care for no knowledge in the world but this, that man hath
sinned, and that God hath suffered; that God hath made himself
the Son of man, and that men are made the righteousness of
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; And now we may proceed to the last subject of our
remark; viz., that this atonement <i>is final</i>, that is to
say, that there can be no possibility of repetition, no second
propitiation, no re-enactment of the scene on Calvary.</p>
<p>That there can be no further offering of any kind whatever,
follows at once from the perfection of our Lord&rsquo;s
atonement.&nbsp; If the whole curse of sin has been blotted out
for ever, what place is there for any further propitiation?&nbsp;
What can cleanse that which is already white as snow?&nbsp; What
sin can be laid on the victim, when we are made the righteousness
of God in Christ?&nbsp; What <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>can satisfy a law which has been long
since satisfied in Christ?&nbsp; What can make expiation for a
curse, when the curse itself has been already blotted out through
his blood?</p>
<p>Nor is this the inference of merely human reason.&nbsp; If it
were, we might well distrust it, for what is the human intellect
to dive into the unfathomable depths of eternal wisdom?&nbsp; But
it is the conclusion drawn by St. Paul, under the direct
inspiration of the Spirit.&nbsp; In the ninth and tenth chapters
of the Epistle to the Hebrews, he is led to the discussion of
this very subject.&nbsp; If you study the passage from chap. ix.
25 to chap. x. 18, you will observe that the whole argument turns
upon this principle, that an offering, if imperfect, requires
repetition,&mdash;if perfect, is final.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
law,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;having a shadow of good things to
come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those
sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually, make the
comers thereunto perfect; for then would they not have ceased to
be offered?&nbsp; Because that the worshippers once purged should
have had no more conscience of sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words,
these sacrifices being merely shadows, and being ineffective to
the perfecting of the conscience, were repeated year by year; but
had they been perfect, they would at once have ceased for
ever.&nbsp; Repetition, therefore, is the result of imperfection,
and where there is full remission, there can be no more sacrifice
for sins.&nbsp; It is impossible, therefore, to admit the idea of
any further propitiation whatever, of any kind, or by any person,
without throwing reflection on that wrought out for us by the
Lord.&nbsp; If his work is perfect, there can be no repetition
needed; and if any fresh oblation is still required for the
putting away of sin, it can only be because there was some defect
or failure in the great work wrought out by our Lord upon the
cross.&nbsp; If, as he said, it was finished then, it is quite
impossible it should be repeated now.</p>
<p>Still less can there be any second offering of our Lord Jesus
Christ himself.&nbsp; It would be strange to suppose that there
could be any fresh propitiation made by any fresh victim, but
stranger still would be the idea that the Saviour himself, the
Son of God, should again suffer for man.&nbsp; The whole plan of
the Gospel from the beginning to the end is a uniform
contradiction to such a thought.&nbsp; There was a long and
progressive work planned in eternal wisdom for the Holy One, of
which his incarnation, <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>his life, his death, his
resurrection, his ascension, his mediation, and his coming reign
are successive steps.&nbsp; And all these are essential to each
other; his mediation, <i>e.g.</i>, is essential to his atonement,
and his atonement to his mediation.&nbsp; If there had been no
atonement there could have been no mediation, for there would
have been no offering to present; and if there had been no
mediation, then the atonement had been valueless, for there had
been no priest to present it before God.&nbsp; So, again, with
the crucifixion and the resurrection; had there been no death
there could have been no resurrection, and had there been no
resurrection, there would have been no acceptance of the perfect
satisfaction in the death.&nbsp; We are therefore to regard the
whole as one divinely appointed work, and we learn that as at the
appointed time it was necessary to redemption that Christ should
die, so now that the resurrection day is past, it is no less
needful that he should live.&nbsp; It would subvert the whole
plan and economy of the Gospel to suppose that he could be a
second time offered.&nbsp; It would utterly neutralize the
resurrection, for when he rose from the dead he was accepted in
the completeness of his satisfaction, and welcomed with the
words, &ldquo;Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; It is no less opposed to the
doctrine of his mediation, for it is a living priest that we
require, and it is because he ever liveth that &ldquo;he is able
to save to the uttermost all them that come unto God by
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is no less in violation with every
description of his glory, for though he appears in heaven as the
Lamb, that <i>has been</i> slain, he has declared from that very
throne that he can be slain no more: &ldquo;I am he that liveth,
and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need not say that these are the principles of the Church of
England.&nbsp; They are distinctly contained in the sentence of
the Article, &ldquo;the offering of Christ <i>once</i>
made.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether or not they are the principles of the
Church of Rome, I leave you to judge from the following extracts
from the decrees of the Council of Trent respecting the
Mass:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And since the same Christ who once offered himself by
his blood on the altar of the cross, is contained in this divine
sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, and offered without
blood, the Holy Council teaches that this sacrifice is really <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>propitiatory,
and made by Christ himself; so that if we approach God contrite
and penitent, with a true heart and sincere faith, we obtain
mercy and find grace in seasonable aid.&nbsp; For assuredly God
is appeased by this oblation, bestows grace, and the gift of
repentance, and forgives all crimes and sins how great soever;
for the sacrifice which is now offered by the ministry of the
priests is one and the same as that which Christ then offered on
the cross, only the mode of offering is different.&rdquo; <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a></p>
<p>Now looking at these words you observe that they contain two
or three most startling statements.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; That there is a propitiatory sacrifice offered
continually.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; That the reason of this propitiatory sacrifice is
that God is not yet appeased, or, in other words, that the
atonement is incomplete, for it says, &ldquo;God is appeased by
this oblation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; That the victim offered is the very same, namely,
the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The wafer is said to be
transubstantiated into the living person, body, soul, and
divinity, of the Lord, and as such to be offered without blood
upon the altar; as is yet more distinctly stated in the
Catechism, where it says: &ldquo;We confess that the sacrifice
offered in the Mass <i>is one and the same as that offered on the
cross</i>; <i>seeing that the victim is one and the same</i>;
<i>namely</i>, <i>Christ our Lord</i>, who offered himself as a
bloody offering once only on the altar of the cross, <i>for the
bloody and unbloody victims are not two victims</i>, <i>but one
only</i>, whose sacrifice, according to the Lord&rsquo;s
commands, Do this in remembrance of me, is daily renewed in the
Eucharist.&rdquo; <a name="citation20b"></a><a
href="#footnote20b" class="citation">[20b]</a></p>
<p>Now, if there be any Roman Catholic here to-night, I would
most earnestly ask of him, how such language can be reconciled
with the clear statements of the Word of God?&nbsp; Mark how St.
Paul, in the chapters to which I have referred, again and again
declares that there can be no fresh offering of the Lord.&nbsp;
He says, in chap. ix. 26, &ldquo;Now <i>once</i> in the end of
the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can he, then, be appearing daily in his
human person, that he may be sacrificed again?&nbsp; He says,
chap. ix. 28, &ldquo;So Christ was <i>once</i> offered to bear
the sins of many;&rdquo; and chap. x. 10, &ldquo;By the which
will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus
Christ <i>once for all</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it possible, then,
that he should be offered every Sunday on ten thousand Romish
altars?&nbsp; He says, chap. x. 12, &ldquo;This man, after he had
offered <i>one</i> sacrifice for sin, <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>for ever, sat down on the right hand
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; How then can we believe that be is now dying
as a second sacrifice upon earth?&nbsp; He says, x. 14, &ldquo;By
<i>one</i> offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified,&rdquo; and if that one offering is sufficient to give
to us all a full and perfect justification before God, how can
those who are thus perfected admit the idea of a second sacrifice
to appease God&rsquo;s justice, and a second victim to obtain
forgiveness at his hands?&nbsp; No, dear brethren, that one
offering was once and for ever.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;eternal
redemption&rdquo; that the Lord then obtained for us.&nbsp;
Eighteen centuries have passed since it was offered, and have
borne down in their passage thousands and tens of thousands of
happy spirits, who, washed in that living fountain, have found a
peaceful reception in the Lord.&nbsp; They have each one borne
with them the sad taint of deep corruption, and have grieved in
spirit over indwelling sin.&nbsp; They have been placed in
various spheres in life, some buffetted by the rough adventures
of this stormy world, some led through the fire of persecution,
and called as witnesses for Christ to stand alone in their faith;
while others have been led in the softer dealings of the Spirit
by smoother paths, and to more gentle resting-places; but all
have gained their strength from one source, and derived their
peace from one truth&mdash;that source Christ Jesus; that truth
the one most certain fact, that the Lord has made on the cross a
full, perfect, and sufficient satisfaction for their sin.&nbsp;
Upon it they lived, upon it they died, by it they triumphed, and
through it they will all be presented faultless at the
coming.</p>
<p>And that fountain is as fresh now as ever; that atonement is
as perfect in its application to us as it was to them.&nbsp; We
too have our indwelling sin, our deep inbred corruption, which
without atonement must destroy us for eternity, but we have the
atonement, and resting in it we may be safe.</p>
<p>Now the whole controversy with Rome turns on the power and
application of that atonement to the conscience of sinners.&nbsp;
It is not a question of mere historical antiquity, or
ecclesiastical genealogy, but one involving the soul&rsquo;s
peace.&nbsp; The soul needs peace, and in the Scriptures peace is
promised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you,&rdquo; was the clear and unfailing promise of the
Lord.&nbsp; But in order to [obtain] that peace we must receive
the atonement as God has revealed it, viz., as a full, perfect,
and final expiation for our sin.&nbsp; How can there be peace <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>while we are
striving to effect an impossibility, and to make satisfaction to
that broken law which could only be satisfied by the blood of the
Son of God?&nbsp; How can there be peace while we are toiling to
reach the atonement instead of simply trusting it, and hoping by
holiness, good works, and penance to make such a qualifying
righteousness, as shall fit us for the reception of the grace of
God?&nbsp; How can there be peace if the justice of God still
hangs over the accepted believer, and requires centuries of
purgatorial flame as a further expiation for his forgiven
sin?&nbsp; How can there be peace if we are to regard the work on
the cross as still requiring repetition in the mass, and directed
to the Saviour as still offered on the altar instead of mediating
at the right hand of God?</p>
<p>Away then with all thoughts of any human satisfaction, of
anything that man can do to make a compensation for his
sins!&nbsp; Our one compensation is the fact that the Lord Jesus
has endured the curse of all.&nbsp; Away with all limits to that
work of his, which may either fetter its freedom or detract from
its fulness! our hope is that it reaches down so low that the
guilty sinner need bring nothing as the purchase of his
reconciliation, and it rises so high that he stands accepted in
the righteousness of God.&nbsp; Away with all thoughts of either
requiring or presenting any fresh propitiation, with all idea of
offering a second time the risen Lord, who now reigns exalted on
the throne.&nbsp; The one great propitiation was enough, and we
want no more.&nbsp; We know that there is deep corruption eating
into the very heart&rsquo;s core; we know that we cannot stand a
moment before God without atonement, but we know also&mdash;and
we hope to spend eternity in praising God for that blessed
knowledge, that the atonement then made was perfect; and that he
who then died our death now lives to perfect our life.&nbsp; On
him therefore we cast the whole burden, without limitation, as
without reserve, and trusting to him and his work, we find peace
and salvation for our souls.</p>
<h2><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>PRAYER
TO BE USED AT THE MEETINGS OF THE ISLINGTON PROTESTANT
INSTITUTE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Almighty God</span>, who hast built Thy
Church upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner-stone, and hast promised
that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; we approach
Thee in the name of Him who is the one Mediator, the Way, the
Truth, and the Life.</p>
<p>We praise and magnify Thy holy name for Thy distinguishing
goodness towards us as inhabitants of this Christian land, and
members of a Reformed and scriptural Church.&nbsp; [We adore Thy
grace in that wonderful interposition of Thy Providence, by which
our fathers were rescued from the yoke of superstitious bondage,
and taught to serve Thee in spirit and in truth.]</p>
<p>But we confess that we have not rendered again according to
the benefit we have received.&nbsp; We have neither prized nor
improved our privileges as we ought.&nbsp; [We have sinned, and
our fathers have sinned, and we have reason to fear lest there
should be wrath upon us and upon our people, and lest Thou
shouldest pour out the spirit of slumber and delusion upon
us.]&nbsp; Yet Thou art the same Lord, whose property is always
to have mercy.&nbsp; Remember not our offences, nor the offences
of our forefathers.&nbsp; Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts;
cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>Direct our hearts and minds by Thy Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Give us
understanding of the times to know what we ought to do.&nbsp; Let
Thy merciful help especially prevent and follow us as members of
this Society.&nbsp; May we begin, continue, and end everything in
Thee.&nbsp; [Let us not contend for names and words, but for Thy
glory, and the truth of Thy Gospel.]&nbsp; Grant us a simple love
of the truth, and an experimental acquaintance with it.&nbsp;
[Let us not be &ldquo;carried about with divers and strange
doctrines,&rdquo; but let our hearts be &ldquo;established with
grace.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>And let us not only believe with the heart, but with the mouth
make confession.&nbsp; With meekness of wisdom may we ever be <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>ready to
defend our principles and to protest against error.&nbsp; Let us
unite holy zeal, boldness, and stedfastness, with a spirit of
genuine charity.&nbsp; Grant us a right judgment in all things,
Christian unanimity in our counsels, and perseverance in
well-doing.&nbsp; [Keep us humble, depending entirely upon the
promised grace and help of Thy Holy Spirit, and watchful, as
those who are not ignorant of the devices of Satan.]</p>
<p>Raise up, we earnestly entreat Thee, champions for the truth;
revive in our days the spirit of the martyrs and reformers of
old.&nbsp; Spare to Thy Church those who are zealous for
Thee.&nbsp; May the faithful never fail from among us, but let
the rising youth be trained to walk in the good old paths.</p>
<p>And as Thou hast commanded prayers and intercessions to be
made for all men, we beseech Thee for our sovereign lady, Queen
Victoria, [that she may ever be mindful of the responsibilities
of her office and the obligation of her oath.&nbsp; Bless
abundantly] the Ministers of State [Guide] and [govern] the
senate of our land.&nbsp; [Strengthen and encourage those
Protestant Representatives who are faithful to Thy cause;
increase their influence, and add to their numbers.&nbsp; Pour
out Thy Spirit upon all estates of the realm, the clergy and the
laity, the rich and the poor.&nbsp; May they strive together, as
members of one body, for the common faith.&nbsp; Let it please
Thee to comfort and succour all oppressed Protestants, and
confessors of the truth, enabling them to forgive their enemies,
and to maintain their own stedfastness.]&nbsp; And very earnestly
do we beseech thee to bring into the way of truth all such as
have erred and are deceived.&nbsp; Strengthen such as do stand,
and raise up them that fall.</p>
<p>[Finally, we commend ourselves and the work of our hands unto
Thee, entreating Thee to accept our persons and our services, not
weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences; and so to
overrule all events,&mdash;nay, even the errors and infirmities
of Thy servants,&mdash;to the advancement of Thy glory, and the
good of Thy Church, that truth and liberty, piety and peace, may
be established among us to all generations.]</p>
<p>These and all other mercies we humbly beg in the name and
mediation of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, our most
blessed Lord and Saviour.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Amen</span>.</p>

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
